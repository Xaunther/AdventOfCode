## Structure

Each daily puzzle is solved in its respective year/day folder, which builds the corresponding executable that solves it. It also contains necessary inputs/outputs for the specific puzzle.

2020 edition probably needs fixing due to changes to avoid compiler errors and warnings placed while solving 2021 edition. It is also a mess.

2021 tries to follow the exact same structure for each day, while factorizing and compartimenting as much code as possible.
